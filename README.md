# IP_Searcher
#### A small program I wrote for a hacker-simulator game. It accepts an input.txt file containing logs or other text, finds all the ip addresses in it, and writes them to the output.txt without duplicates.

Source txt-file have many strings, and two ip-adresses in every string

Program search all ip-addresses, create or re-write output.txt, and write all addresses without duplicates

The result of the program helps to save a lot of time.
